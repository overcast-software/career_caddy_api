Given the following webpage HTML content, extract the job title, company name, posted date, and the job description from the HTML:

HTML: {{ html_content }}

Please provide the title, company, posted_date, and the description of the job in the following JSON format:

{
    "title": "{{title}}",
    "description": "{{description}}",
    "company_name": "{{company}}",
    "company_display_name": "{{display_name}}",
    "posted_date": "{{posted_date}}",
    "extraction_date": "{{today_date}}"
}

posted date is null if not explicit.
If the posted_date is relative, extrapolate it from {{today_date}}.
It is mandatory that you remove any markdown from the response and only respond with a JSON-compliant string.
Be certain to evaluate the accuracy of the format of your answer before responding.
Make sure no markdown such as '```json' exists in the response.
