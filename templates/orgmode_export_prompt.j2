Given the following example org mode document of my resume:
{{example_resume}}

Take the text that follows and convert it into an org document following as closely as possible to the original:

{{resume_string}}

The response should be only the body of the file without commentary.
The output is going directly into the file and no markdown should accompany the response.
Be sure to check that the response is only org mode text and nothing else.
